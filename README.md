# LinkedIn-Search-Bot

The LinkedIn Search Bot is proprietary technology developed for the HR department at a hospital. The department was screening applicants one by one, and applications were being submitted faster than the department could gather data on the applicants (not to mention review that data once collected). This bot aggregates relevant data from LinkedIn and other social media for a given applicant. The bot then reviews each piece of data it has collected, and scores it against an applicant's resume and other application information to ensure that the information gathered pertains to the correct applicant, not someone with the same name or similar background.
